# Video Content Safety Dataset
### For Hybrid LSTM-MLP Classification

This dataset contains pre-computed feature vectors and intermediate neural network outputs designed to train the **safety classification module** of [EmotionLib](https://github.com/EmotionEngineer/EmotionLib). It is used to discriminate between safe media and sensitive content (NSFW/Gore).

## 📂 Dataset Structure

The dataset is composed of high-level statistical features and raw temporal inference data.

### 1. Statistical Features (`mlp-intermediate.csv`)
Used for the statistical branch of the hybrid model (SAMP).
- **`filename`**: Anonymized identifier (e.g., `G-101`, `R-1020`).
- **`predict1`...`predict30`**: Intermediate outputs from a NAS-found ensemble of three Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). These represent condensed statistical descriptors of the video.
- **`target`**: Ground truth label.
  - `0.0`: **Safe** (G, PG, PG-13, R).
  - `1.0`: **Unsafe** (NC-17, Gore, Explicit).

### 2. Temporal Data (`/Data` directory)
Contains binary feature files generated by the primary CNN cores.
- **`.efp` (Filter Predictions)**: Frame-by-frame probabilities for Safe/Explicit/Gore classes.
- **`.epp` (Positiveness Predictions)**: Frame-by-frame emotional tone analysis.

## 📝 Binary File Format
The raw data in the `/Data` directory follows a strict binary layout:

| Offset | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | `int32` | **num_frames** (N) |
| 4 | `int32` | **interval** (seconds between frames) |
| 8+ | `float32[N]` | **Probabilities** (Sequence of probability vectors) |

## ⚖️ Ethical & Anonymization Statement
To adhere to ethical safety standards and copyright regulations, **all filenames have been anonymized** (e.g., `R-1041`). The original titles are withheld to prevent direct association with specific explicit or violent material found in source media. The dataset focuses solely on abstract content patterns required for algorithmic training.

## 🚀 Usage
This dataset is intended for use with the **EmotionLib Filter Training** pipeline.
